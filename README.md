# hello-world
Just another hello world repository. Fortunately this one it's not like the others.
My aim is not to exclude you from my projects or boring you, so let's partecipate all together
in this new exciting hello world project just singing a song:


I never meant to cause you any sorrow / 
I never meant to cause you any pain / 
I only wanted to one time to see you laughing / 
I only wanted to see you / 
Laughing in the purple rain...


Now I am pretty confident that you can continue by you own :)
